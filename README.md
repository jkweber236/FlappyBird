# Overview

My goal was to create a simple game using Java to further my understanding of the language syntax. This Java program utilizes the Swing framework to the create a graphical user interface for the game.
The program, "Jump Master," is a basic jumping game where the character must navigate through a moving landscape of obstacles. The game mechanics involve players making the character jump by pressing the space bar, adding an interactive layer to the user experience. 
The main components include a character (represented by a blue circle), obstacles (represented by black rectangles), and a scoring system. 
The project aimed to reinforce knowledge of event handling, timers, graphical rendering, and basic collision detection in a gaming context.

# Development Environment

The software was developed using the Java programming language. The primary tools and technologies include: 
- Visual Studio Code 
- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Git/GitHub
- Swing (GUI Framework)

# Future Work

- Enhance visual elements, such as better graphics for the character and obstacles
- Implement levels with increasing difficulty
- Increase the complexity and variety of the obstacles 
- Implement a high-score system and allow it to save to a file
- Refactor code for better maintability and readability
